# 18. Consenus as default mechanism instead of consent

Date: 2023-09-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Using consent will ad additional complexity when we are checking if nobody sent a transaction. for a smart-contract to know that there was no proposal decline transaction would require incentives sysyem and infrastructure to monitor all transaction and penilize those who censor a transaction. Therefore we change the default model to Consensus.

## Decision

Default model for DAO is Consensus.

## Consequences

What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated.
